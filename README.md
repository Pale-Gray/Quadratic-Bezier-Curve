Just a single Quadratic Bezier Curve for fun

##About

This is just a github repository of a singular Quadratic Bezier Curve. I gained inspiration from (this)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVwxzDHniEw&t=624s], so I decided to make one.

It just shows you what a bezier curve does really, press c to clear the bezier, press a to animate, press up and down arrow keys to manually move, and press the three black points to move them.
